# Topic: Searching Algorithm
• All codes must be complete and compile without any errors.
• The codes should work for not only the given sample inputs but also any inputs of the same data types.
## Q1. (10 + 10 = 20 marks)
Implement the linear search algorithm and the interpolation algorithm (either iterative or recursive) for an integer array and search for a key in the array. Prompt the user for all inputs.
Sample Input:
Enter the number of elements in the array: 10
Enter the elements in the array:
23
12
11
34
45
65
33
10
11
19
Enter the search key: 11
Sample Output:
Using Linear Search:
Search key FOUND at index 2.
Using Interpolation Search:
Search key FOUND at index 2.
* Show “Search key NOT FOUND” if nothing matches the search key.
## Q2. (5 marks)
Compare their running times and show them. Which one performed better and why?
## Q3 (5 marks)
Try to improve the running time of the linear search by at least 20% and explain your logic.
